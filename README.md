# Photobox Full Stack JS test

This test is designed for potential full stack developers to demonstrate their coding skills. It's intended to be done in less than 90 minutes, but don't hold back in showing your skills. We're mainly interested in seeing how you approach this problem and how far you'll get.

The test does not have any intentional bugs. So if you do find any, you can relay them back to us. Start by creating a fork, add your changes and send us a link back to your work.

## Deliverable

Your task is to create part of a listing page for the products that you receive from an API. The data for the listing page can be accessed via `/api/products` (see. /api folder). Tip: Where are the decimal indicators for the prices! :)

Please return at minimum a component and a test using `jest`. Feel free to import any modules that you feel you require or make any changes you deem necesary.

This is what a single product card should look like:

![listing page product card example](/src/images/design.png)

Behaviour of product cards at differen't breakpoints:
- Mobile (320px > screen < 480px): one product card per row
- Tablet (480px > screen < 768px): two product cards per row
- Desktop (768 px > screen < inf): three product cards per row

The product cards should be contained within 1024px and be aligned in the centre.

If the user types in any other URL, it should return a basic 404 page. Keep it stateless, if possible. If you want to impress, change express to koa and use redux.

# Bill's Notes

- Notable changes to build setup:
    - updated to React 16.8
    - enabled css modules
- Motiviations:
    - Redux - the way I have structured the redux code is in-line with what I have found works really well in my experience. Each "module" is completely self-contained, even injecting itself into the store. You may only interact with that part of the store via functions exported from that module.
    - Components - although the (minimum) requirement was for _one_ component, I prefer to modularise and break components up, obviously for re-usability and composibility, but also to aid readability and intuition. If I could spend more time, I would have also created a `Cta` (or `Button`) and `Price` component (which could take care of converting currency in future) from the implementation in the `ProductCard` component. Bear in mind that I have automations for creating boilerplate for new components so the extra overhead is minimal.
    - I totally skipped the koa bonus requirement because although I have read up on koa (and it does seem very straight forward), I haven't used it before, and I am also not extremely confident with SSR, so I decided that that task might take more time than I could/should put towards it. Given the time and prioritisation this is something I could certainly achieve without any problem.
- What went wrong:
    - Looks like I broke SSR at some point. I'm sure I could fix it without too much effort but I decided it wasn't worth my spending time on as it's probably outside the scope of this exercise.
    - Image paths weren't prefixed with /dist (which is where the only image is served from) - I added this into the mock data in api/products.json as I would expect a server to give me a full path.
    - I noticed an FOUC (due to SSR and having to wait for styles to finish loading). This was present before I touched the codebase.
- Disclosure
    - A small proportion of the code is boilerplate which I almost always re-use, but they are mainly quite small util functions. Pretty much all of the code inside /store, apart from the products.js module, is boilerplate with minor amendments.
    - I squashed my commits and re-wrote them in order to have a cleaner git history.
    - The boilerplate for my test files is autogenerated (vscode snippets), so that's why some of them look identical apart from the component name. I would like to have spent more time fleshing these tests out but didn't think it was worth spending a lot of time on over other things.
